# ARETE All Hands Meeting May 2022
Welcome to the ARETE 2022 all-hands meeting organization page.
In the all-hands meeting, we will be combining in-person and remote collaboration with teams across North America and the UK to discuss project concepts, accomplishments, and goals.

This page is meant to serve as a central depot for talk materials and slides. The repositories in the page are organized by conference day, with each day containing directories corresponding to a given lecture.
